## Project Overview

Pennsylvania faces significant demographic, economic, and environmental disparities across its counties. These differences exist regarding educational attainment, income, unemployment, poverty, and access to public resources like parks and recreational spaces. Such disparities necessitate a data-driven approach to inform equitable resource allocation and policy-making. This work flow outlines findings from an analysis of key socioeconomic indicators and spatial patterns across the state, providing recommendations to guide resource allocation and address disparities effectively.

The analysis seeks to answer two key research questions: (1) Are demographic, economic, and environmental factors spatially correlated across Pennsylvania? and (2) How can the identification of similar county clusters help policymakers equitably allocate resources? Using advanced geospatial and clustering techniques, we grouped counties based on shared socioeconomic characteristics, identifying areas of high need and areas of strength. The findings from this study inform actionable recommendations for allocating resources to foster equitable growth and prosperity across Pennsylvania.
 
The data for this analysis was taken from the American Community Survey (ACS), supplemented with local datasets on park access and unemployment. Key variables included median household income, unemployment rates, poverty levels, educational attainment, and local park coverage. These variables were standardized and used to create clusters of counties, revealing patterns of need and opportunity. The spatial correlations between these factors highlight the interconnectedness of education, income, and access to public resources in shaping socioeconomic outcomes.
 
Our analysis identified four distinct clusters of counties. The first cluster, labeled “Prosperous Counties,” includes areas like Chester and Montgomery counties. These counties exhibit high educational attainment, elevated median incomes, low poverty, and extensive park coverage, reflecting their overall prosperity. The second cluster, “Emerging Counties,” includes areas like Lancaster and York counties. These counties show moderate economic performance but are hindered by gaps in educational attainment and elevated unemployment rates, indicating potential for targeted intervention. The third cluster, “Struggling Counties,” encompasses areas such as Fayette, Luzerne, and Northumberland counties. These counties face severe challenges, including high poverty rates, low incomes, high unemployment, and limited park access. Finally, the fourth cluster, “Urban Economic Hubs,” includes Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. These urban centers have high populations and economic significance but also exhibit high income inequality and pockets of poverty.
 
Key spatial correlations identified in the analysis reveal that counties with higher educational attainment consistently report higher incomes and lower unemployment rates. Conversely, counties with elevated poverty levels often experience limited access to parks and recreational spaces, suggesting a gap in public investment. Additionally, rural counties face systemic challenges in education and economic opportunity, while urban areas exhibit concentrated inequality alongside stronger infrastructural assets.
 
Based on these findings, we recommend a series of targeted interventions. First, investing in education and workforce development should be prioritized in struggling counties like Fayette, Luzerne, and Northumberland. This could include scholarship programs, vocational training, and partnerships with local industries to create employment pathways. Second, job creation and economic revitalization efforts should focus on counties such as Cambria and Schuylkill, where infrastructure improvements can attract employers and stimulate economic growth. Third, enhancing park infrastructure in underserved counties will improve public health and foster community engagement. Counties like Northumberland and Luzerne would particularly benefit from investments in recreational spaces. Finally, urban centers like Philadelphia and Allegheny should be leveraged as hubs for regional growth. These counties can support surrounding areas through workforce pipelines and regional collaboration initiatives.
 
This data-driven approach provides a roadmap for equitable resource allocation across Pennsylvania. Policymakers should prioritize counties with the most pressing needs while leveraging the strengths of prosperous areas to serve as models for best practices. By investing in education, public health, and economic revitalization, Pennsylvania can foster growth and reduce disparities across the state. A commitment to monitoring progress through data-driven tools will ensure accountability and enable policymakers to refine strategies over time. This approach not only addresses current disparities but also lays the foundation for a more equitable and prosperous Pennsylvania for future generations.
